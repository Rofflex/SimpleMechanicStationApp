# Small ERP System for Mechanic Station

## Overview

This project is a small-scale ERP system designed specifically for a mechanic station. It is developed using C# and leverages the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture along with the Singleton design pattern. 
The project embodies object-oriented programming principles to deliver a structured and efficient solution for managing various aspects of a mechanic station's operations.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project is structured using the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the application into three distinct components: Model, View, and ViewModel. This separation enhances code maintainability, reusability, and testability.

- **Singleton Pattern:** The Singleton design pattern ensures that critical components within the application, such as database connections or service providers, have a single instance throughout the application's lifecycle. This promotes efficiency and resource management.

- **Object-Oriented Paradigms:** The project heavily relies on object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to model real-world entities and their relationships. This approach facilitates extensibility and code readability.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed with user experience in mind. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-navigate system for managing tasks related to a mechanic station, including inventory management, employee scheduling, and customer interactions.
